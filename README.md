# bankAccountTests
Just an example of how to use parameterised tests using jUnit in Java

How to run the tests:

-> Open the project on Eclipse or IntelliJ
-> Run the class BankAccountTestParameterized

You can change the parameters on the testConditions method to see different results on the tests. This method basically 
sets up arrays of parameters to initialize variables with these values and then run test methods of them.
